    "Material is the metaphor.\n\n" "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion." "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet " "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n" "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The " "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the " "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical " "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n" "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, " "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows " "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n" "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n" "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, " "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the " "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge " "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic " "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n" "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides " "waypoints for the user.\n\n" "Motion provides meaning.\n\n" "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are " "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n" "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without " "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n" "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. " "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n" "3D world.\n\n" "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z " "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the " "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single " "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n" "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is " "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n" "Light and shadow.\n\n" "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create " "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n" "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android " "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at " "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the " "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n" "Resting elevation.\n\n" "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation " "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting " "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n" "Component elevations.\n\n" "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation " "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n" "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth " "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n" "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n" "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response " "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation " "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n" "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative " "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent " "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have " "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n" "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting " "elevation.\n\n" "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n" "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between " "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass " "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, " "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n" "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. " "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a " "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n" "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. " "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere " "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
